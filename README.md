# Dengue Radar
This is our project which is done in mainly Android Java + Firebase.

Dengue Radar allows users to detect nearby dengue clusters and notify them when they are near a cluster.
We queried Gov API for GeoJSON data of dengue clusters for the past 14 days.
The data is then displayed on Google Maps as clusters marked in red.

Design of the app strictly follows good design architecture and practices. We practice the use of Managers and Interfaces to create a loose coupling and lesser dependency between classes. Modularisation also allowed for the project to be developed by different developers concurrently.
